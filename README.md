## Usage

1. Add any new corrections as a line entry to `corrections.txt`.
2. Run `task load`.

Also check out [AutoSpell](https://github.com/wburningham/AutoSpell) and [atext](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/). I've moved away from it because I wanted my spelling corrections to occur in all applications and work with as existing app I always have running.
